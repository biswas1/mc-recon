Project with multiple directories :

here we have two main directories : 1) src : contains 2 files 2)include: contains 1 file 

for these kind of structure where we have multiple direcory and sub directories CMake is very impotant.The usual practice is having the indivisual makefiles in different subdirectories and then indivisually invoked by the makefile in the parent directory. 

 header files are in include directory 
 source files are in src directory 

* change last line in CMakeLists.txt : 
add_executable(<whatever name you want for your executable> ${sources})

from the build directory we will call the cmake program 
>>cd build 
>>cmake ..
>>make 

this will form an executable : <whatever name you want for your executable>

>>./<whatever name you want for your executable>
